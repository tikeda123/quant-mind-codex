# Model paper sources and artifacts independently

## Quick Summary

- **Purpose**: Define canonical paper source, chunk, summary, annotation, structure, translation, citation, and locator models.
- **Read when**: Changing `quantmind.knowledge.paper`, stable paper identities, artifact lineage, or paper search resolution.
- **Status**: Implemented by `quantmind.knowledge.paper` and persisted by `quantmind.library`.
- **Core rule**: Source revisions are immutable anchors; derived artifacts are independently versioned and never own retrieval vectors.

## Model Layers

Source-first paper handling separates four layers:

| Layer | Canonical aggregate | Addressable members | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Exact source | `PaperSourceRevision` | `PaperAssetRef`, `PaperParsedPage`, `PaperParsedBlock` | Preserve fetched bytes, page-aware parser output, metadata, and visual evidence. |
| Deterministic artifact | `PaperChunkSet` | `PaperChunk`, `PaperSourceSpan` | Record one exact chunking of the source before any summary call. |
| Semantic artifact | `PaperGlobalSummary` | `PaperCitation` | Store one independently versioned model summary with resolvable chunk/page evidence. |
| Annotation artifact | `PaperAnnotationSet` | `PaperAnnotation`, `PaperCitation` | Keep cited source facts, Codex interpretations, and cited user notes explicitly typed. |
| Structural artifact | `PaperStructureTree` | `TreeNode`, `Citation` | Store one independently versioned natural-section hierarchy over exact source pages. |
| Translation artifact | `PaperTranslation` | `PaperTranslationPage` | Store one complete English-to-Japanese reading aid aligned to exact physical pages. |

`PaperSemanticResult` validates one compatible source, chunk set, and summary combination. It is a transfer result, not a fourth stored artifact.

`PaperAnnotatedResult` extends that transfer value with one annotation set. It
checks that every artifact names the same source revision and that every
summary and annotation citation resolves through the included chunk set to an
exact physical page and quote. Personal UI memos are deliberately not a
canonical annotation; they live only in the UI sidecar.

`PaperTranslatedResult` pairs the exact source with one `PaperTranslation` and
rejects missing pages, page-number drift, source-hash drift, or English page
text that differs from the source manifest. Every translation page contains
both exact English source text and Japanese reading text. Translation text is
not citation evidence, and human review state lives only in the UI sidecar.

All models are frozen Pydantic values with `extra="forbid"`. Canonical values contain no embedding vectors, provider node objects, or storage handles.

## Stable Identity

IDs are generated and checked in code:

- source revision ID: UUIDv5 over the exact source SHA-256 hash;
- asset ID: UUIDv5 over source revision, asset kind, page, and asset content hash;
- artifact ID: UUIDv5 over source revision, artifact kind, and producer configuration hash;
- chunk ID: UUIDv5 over chunk-set ID, position, content hash, and source-span hash.
- translation page ID: UUIDv5 over translation artifact, position, physical page, and page content hash.

Producer configuration is canonical JSON with sorted keys before SHA-256 hashing. Chunk-set content hashes cover ordered chunk membership and spans. Summary content hashes cover summary prose and ordered citations.

These identities make an identical run idempotent. They also keep a changed splitter or summary producer from overwriting an older artifact.

## Source and Asset Integrity

`PaperSourceRevision` requires a typed `SourceRef` whose `content_hash` equals the parsed manifest hash and raw-asset hash. arXiv sources require an exact revision suffix. Pages are contiguous and 1-based. Every page visual reference must name a known asset from that page.

`PaperAssetRef` records media type, content hash, byte length, kind, and optional page. Exact blobs are keyed by content hash while the result crosses into persistence. When blobs are loaded, every reference must have bytes with matching length and SHA-256 hash.

The source's canonical JSON excludes blobs. This keeps canonical hashes stable and reviewable while allowing SQLite to store exact bytes in a normalized linked table. Rehydration checks both directions: stored blob bytes must match their table hashes, and table asset metadata must match the canonical source manifest.

Every chunk span is also checked against that manifest: its page must exist, its character range must fit the page text, and every visual asset ID must resolve to a screenshot or image from the same page. This check runs for a complete `PaperSemanticResult` and when a stored chunk set is rehydrated independently.

## Artifact Versioning

`PaperChunkSet.producer` records splitter identity, installed splitter version, chunk size, and overlap. Its members have contiguous positions and must all point back to the artifact and source revision.

`PaperGlobalSummary.producer` records:

- model identity;
- prompt version;
- map-reduce orchestration version;
- exact input chunk-set ID;
- reducer/research instructions hash;
- per-agent output limit;
- research group size.

Changing any producer field creates a distinct artifact ID. Multiple chunk sets and summaries may coexist for one source revision. Loading a complete `PaperSemanticResult` without explicit artifact IDs is allowed only when one unambiguous linked pair exists.

`PaperAnnotationSet` producer identity records an external cited-draft model
label, policy version, instructions hash, complete draft hash, and exact input
chunk-set ID. Annotation IDs and hashes are code-owned and cover kind, text,
position, and ordered citations. Annotation sets create no retrieval
projections in the initial local-search scope.

`PaperStructureTree.producer` records model and prompt identity, the instructions hash, the bounded physical-page text input policy, and tree/output bounds. It deliberately records no splitter or chunk-set identity. Rechunking an unchanged source therefore does not create a different structure tree.

`PaperTranslation.producer` records interactive generator label, fixed language
pair, draft schema/policy, instructions hash, and complete draft hash. The
artifact content hash covers languages and ordered page hashes. It has no chunk
or embedding dependency, so a changed translation creates a new version while
the source identity remains unchanged.

## Citation and Lineage Integrity

A `PaperCitation` identifies the exact chunk set, chunk, page, and optional verbatim quote. `PaperSemanticResult` rejects citations to missing chunks, pages outside the cited chunk spans, or quotes absent from chunk text.

`PaperAnnotationKind` distinguishes `source_fact`, `codex_interpretation`, and
`user_note`. These labels state provenance category, not truth. All three kinds
require at least one exact citation in cited-draft v1.

`PaperGlobalSummary.derived_from` contains `ArtifactLocator` values. At least one locator must point to its producer's exact input chunk set, with the same source revision and no member ID. The library stores this relationship explicitly so lineage can be checked independently from the summary JSON.

`PaperStructureTree` binds directly to one `PaperSourceRevision`. Each node carries inclusive physical-page citations with no chunk coordinates, and the root must cover every source page. The tree has no artifact lineage because no chunk set or summary is an input to its construction.

## Retrieval Boundary

Canonical paper models do not implement `embedding_text()` and do not select retrieval text. `quantmind.library` projects:

- one text-embedding target for the global summary;
- one text-embedding target per paper chunk;
- no aggregate target for a chunk set.
- no target for an annotation set in the initial implementation.
- no target for a translation in the initial implementation.

`ArtifactLocator` addresses a source revision, artifact, artifact kind, and optional member. The optional source revision keeps the locator usable for legacy `BaseKnowledge` results; V1 paper locators always set it. `LocalKnowledgeLibrary.resolve()` returns the canonical summary, chunk set, chunk, translation page, knowledge item, or tree node selected by a locator.

`SearchProjection` is separate from the locator. It records the rebuildable projection kind, version, modality, model, dimensions, and content hash that produced a ranked `SemanticHit`.

## Compatibility Boundary

`LegacyPaper` retains the pre-V1 `TreeKnowledge` shape only so existing version-2 databases and the bundled legacy example can be opened. It is not exported as `Paper`, is not produced by `PaperFlow`, and is not part of the V1 paper contract.

There is no nested `PaperTree` on the V1 result. `PaperStructureTree` is an independently versioned paper-artifact binding of the shared `StructureTree` base, derived directly from one exact source revision and independent of every chunk-set version; see [Build and retrieve from a page-preserving structure tree](../mind/retrieval.md).
