# Context Map

## Quick Summary

- **Purpose**: The navigation index for `contexts/`. Before reading or writing anything under `contexts/`, start here to find the one page a task needs.
- **Read when**: Beginning any repository, design, or library-usage task, or adding a new `contexts/` page (register it in the map below and in its area index).
- **Load next**: Pick the single route in [Where to Start](#where-to-start); then open only that page and follow its `Load next` line.
- **Status**: Current. `AGENTS.md` (imported by `CLAUDE.md`) points here as the first read for `contexts/` work.
