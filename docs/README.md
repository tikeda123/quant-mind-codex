# QuantMind Component Catalog

This is the discovery index for QuantMind's public operations, supported
sources, examples, design documents, and verification commands. Source-specific
acquisition mechanics remain internal unless they are intentionally documented
as a public preprocessing primitive.

Public callable names follow the
[operation naming contract](../contexts/design/operations/naming.md). The runtime API serves
Python callers; coding-agent guidance lives in the repository development
harness.

## Codex Paper Library Manuals

The local Paper Library is a fork-specific, human-operated application. Start
with the Japanese manual for daily use, then use the narrower guides when
building or auditing a runtime.

| Guide | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [日本語運用マニュアル](paper-library-manual-ja.md) | Original/fork relationship, installation, intake, Codex handoff, Japanese translation, image annotations, search, organization, backup, and troubleshooting |
| [Database construction and persistence](paper-library-setup.md) | Exact new-install, schema, migration, acceptance, backup, and restore procedure |
| [Paper Library UI](paper-library-ui.md) | Six views, canonical/sidecar ownership, security boundaries, and limitations |
| [LocalKnowledgeLibrary](library.md) | Public persistence and semantic-retrieval contract |

The fork is [`tikeda123/quant-mind-codex`](https://github.com/tikeda123/quant-mind-codex). The original upstream project is [`LLMQuant/quant-mind`](https://github.com/LLMQuant/quant-mind). The root [README](../README.md#オリジナルとの違い) contains the maintained feature comparison.

## Public Operations

| Local persistence, catalog, and semantic search | `quantmind.library.LocalKnowledgeLibrary` | canonical knowledge, cited or translated paper results, catalog queries, or `SemanticQuery` | stored values, management views, or `list[SemanticHit]` | [Cited paper example](../examples/flows/paper_cited_draft.py) | [Library guide](library.md) |
| Page-aware document RAG | `quantmind.rag.chunk_parsed_document`, `quantmind.rag.retrieve_parsed_document` | `ParsedDocument`, splitter config, and query | `tuple[ParsedDocumentHit, ...]` | [Paper RAG](../examples/rag/paper.py) | [Document RAG design](../contexts/design/rag/document.md) |

Import public inputs and configs from `quantmind.configs`, flow operations and
builders from `quantmind.flows`, and cognitive services from `quantmind.mind`.
Import result contracts from the canonical layer shown in the catalog.

## Public-Network Sources

| Source | Source selection | Operation | Live-network component smoke test |
|---|---|---|---|
| PR Newswire | `NewsWindow(source="pr-newswire", ...)` | `collect_news` | `python scripts/verify_news_e2e.py` |
| arXiv Transformer PDF | `ArxivIdentifier(id="1706.03762v7")` | `PaperFlow(PaperSemanticCfg).build`, persistence, reopen, search, and resolution | `python scripts/verify_pdf_rag_e2e.py` |
| Golden paper PDF (structure) | `LocalFilePath(...golden/paper.pdf)` | `PaperFlow.build`, standalone `put`/`open_structure`, and `AgenticRetriever.retrieve` | `python scripts/verify_structure_e2e.py` |

The PR Newswire smoke test checks the public RSS feed, a complete preceding
24-hour listing window, and ticker-hint recall on a bounded sample of up to 25
article pages. The `news` job in `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` runs daily, on
manual dispatch, and only on pull requests that change its dependency paths.
It is not a required merge check, so external PR Newswire availability cannot
block unrelated changes.

The `paper-flow` job fetches exact arXiv revision `1706.03762v7`, preserves at
least 15 pages, runs bounded `gpt-5.6-luna` summarization, persists summary and
chunk projections with `text-embedding-3-small`, reopens the database, searches
both artifact kinds, and resolves every hit. It runs daily, manually, and on
pull requests that change its dependency paths, and it remains non-required
because arXiv and model providers are public-network dependencies.

The `structure` job builds a self-contained `PaperStructureTree` from the local
golden fixture PDF under the default model, dumps and reopens it through the
library unchanged, and runs a real `AgenticRetriever` traversal. It exercises the
one path offline tests mock away (a real structured-output draft call and a real
agentic loop). It runs daily, manually, and on pull requests that change its
dependency paths, and it remains non-required because model providers are a
public-network dependency.
When the repository `OPENAI_API_KEY` secret is unavailable, the job emits an
explicit skip notice instead of reporting an implementation failure; the
catalog command remains the direct way to run the same bounded slice locally.

## Verification

Run the deterministic required verification for every change:

```bash
bash scripts/verify.sh
```

It covers formatting, linting, typing, import boundaries, unit tests, and
coverage, and must remain network-free. The required `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
workflow runs this same harness after file-hygiene hooks. When a change affects
a public-network component, also run every applicable live-network smoke test
listed above; `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` owns those component jobs.

The API-key-free local paper workflow has two explicit operator checks. The UI
shell check is network-free and does not load a model. The paper check requires
the exact revision to have been cached by an earlier explicit command, then
keeps normal model loading local-only:

```bash
python scripts/verify_paper_library_ui.py
python scripts/verify_local_paper_e2e.py \
  --cache-dir /absolute/path/to/quantmind-models
python scripts/migrate_paper_library.py \
  --source-library-db /absolute/path/to/paper-library.sqlite3 \
  --source-ui-db /absolute/path/to/paper-library-ui.sqlite3 \
  --destination-root /absolute/path/to/new-runtime-root \
  --model-cache /absolute/path/to/quantmind-models \
  --query "portfolio covariance" \
  --query "ポートフォリオの共分散"
```

See the [Japanese operating manual](paper-library-manual-ja.md) for the
human workflow and troubleshooting. The
[database construction guide](paper-library-setup.md) provides the complete
new-install, first-registration, translation, image-annotation, migration,
verification, and backup runbook. The [local paper UI guide](paper-library-ui.md)
covers views, data ownership, security boundaries, and known limitations.
The migration command copies and verifies the complete canonical/sidecar pair
without overwriting an existing destination. None of these commands creates a
new scheduled workflow or calls Codex from Python.

## Adding a Public Operation or Source

Use the `quantmind-dev` component workflow. A public operation is not complete
until its typed contract, package exports, offline tests, focused example,
design or guide, and catalog row agree. A public-network source additionally
needs mocked source tests plus a bounded live verifier and component job in
`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`.

Each live component owns one `scripts/verify_<component>_e2e.py` command and
one named job in the existing `e2e.yml`. Extend the workflow's precise PR path
filter for the component. When multiple live jobs exist, use GitHub-native
per-job change detection so only affected component jobs run. Add commands only
to the catalog above; root agent guidance stays component-neutral. Do not
create a workflow per component or a generic E2E runner, registry, or base
class.
